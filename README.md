# Overview
*Patient condition classification*, which predicts the medical issue of a sentence and recommends drugs to prevent or treat that issue, involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze text input and provide relevant medical information. This project uses natural language processing and machine learning to classify patient conditions based on input text and recommend appropriate medications.


## Technologies Used

- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11%2B-blue): The core programming language used for NLP and machine learning algorithms.
- ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-1.3.0-blue), ![NLTK](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLTK-3.8.1-blue), ![spaCy](https://img.shields.io/badge/spaCy-3.6-green): Libraries for natural language processing and machine learning.
- ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-2.3.3-green): For building the web-based user interface.

  ## Key Features

- **Medical Condition Prediction**: The system can predict a patient's medical condition based on their symptoms, medical history, and descriptions provided in natural language.

- **Drug Recommendation**: It provides drug recommendations tailored to the identified medical condition, taking into account factors like patient allergies and contraindications.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction, making it accessible to both healthcare providers and patients.
